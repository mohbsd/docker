1. How to use internal volumes
>> /var/lib/docker/volumes = contain volumes
# docker run -d -ti --name container_name -v /data busybox (create volume for the container, then you can find the volume on the container and on the local host machine)
. -v = volume
# docker inspect container_name |less (see the mount section to find the created volume)

2. How to use external volumes
>> bind mount directory or file from the host file system <<

# mkdir /mnt/dir1 (create a directory on the host filesystem)
# echo Test > /mnt/dir1/dir1testfile.txt (create a testfile on it)
# docker run -d -ti --name container_nameA -v /mnt/dir1:/data image_name
(this mounts a subdirectory with a file inside on the host file system to the directory /data on the container)
(data created on the container can be viewed on the host fs and vice versa)

<<mount a volume from a container to another one>>
# docker run -d -ti --name container_nameB --volumes-from=container_nameA image_name
(this mounts the external volume from container_nameA to container_nameB)(and everything you write on the volume is readable on both containers because you mounted an external volume to containers)#
# docker inspect container_name |less 
(it shows the "Binds" section what host directory/volume is mounted on what container directory )

<< mount a read only volume to containers >>
# mkdir /mnt/dir2
# docker run -d -ti --name container_nameC -v /mnt/dir2:/data:ro image_name
# docker attach container_nameC	
(you will be able to list and only read the /data directory)


3. Removing volumes

# docker stop container_name
# docker rm -v container_name
. -v = volume
(it removes the volume inside the container but not inside the host fs)

4. Copying files from and to containers	
c1 = container1
c2 = container2
<<copy file from container to local host>>
# docker cp c1:/data/testfile.txt /tmp/
# ls /tmp/
testfile.txt

<<copy file from host to container>>
# docker cp /tmp/testfile.txt c2:/data/
(possible just from docker 1.8)
